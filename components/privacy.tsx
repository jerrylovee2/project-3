            <p className="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed">
            We are happy to welcome your pets to Hadley Inn, as part of your stay, provided they are accommodated in designated pet-friendly rooms. To ensure we can offer the best experience for both you and your furry companions, we kindly request that you inform us in advance if you plan to bring a pet. This allows us to make the necessary arrangements and ensure that a suitable room is available.
            <br></br>    <br></br>  
Pets must be fully trained and restrained on a leash in public areas and in your Supervision. Behavior: Pets should not cause disturbances, such as excessive barking, that inconvenience other guests. Guests are responsible for cleaning up after their pets in the hotel and neighborhood. The owner is responsible for any damage caused by their pet.
<br></br>    <br></br>  
If a pet bites someone, the owner is liable for any injuries sustained, may be required to take steps to manage the aggressive behavior (like training or muzzling), and could face consequences depending on the severity of the bite, including potential removal of the pet from the property or legal action, often governed by local laws andÂ regulations. 
<br></br>    <br></br>  
Please note that additional policies and fees may apply for pet stays, and we encourage you to contact us ahead of time for more details. Our goal is to create a comfortable and enjoyable environment for all of our guests, including those traveling with pets.
